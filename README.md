# ShipIt Inventory Management

## Setup Instructions
Open the project in VSCode.
VSCode should automatically set up and install everything you'll need apart from the database connection!

### Setting up the Database.
Create 2 new postgres databases - one for the main program and one for our test database.
Ask a team member for a dump of the production databases to create and populate your tables.

Then for each of the projects, add a `.env` file at the root of the project.
That file should contain a property named `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`.
It should look something like this:
```
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Database=your_database_name;User Id=your_database_user; Password=your_database_password;

```
Within each project run the following commands:
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL

May need to amend versions in the ShipIt.csproj

## Running The API
Once set up, simply run dotnet run in the ShipIt directory.

## Running The Tests
To run the tests you should be able to run dotnet test in the ShipItTests directory.

## Deploying to Production
